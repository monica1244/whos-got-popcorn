### Overview
Created using the [TMDB movies dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/tmdb/tmdb-movie-metadata?select=tmdb_5000_credits.csv), our website showcases movie information in the form of cluster bubbles and a timeline view. Using our system, users can find new movies to watch based on their preferences. They can also gain insights into various trends around movies. Designed with a focus on User Experience design principles, our system packs numerous interaction capabilities within a single page. The system features a zoomable circle packing layout wherein similar movies are clustered together based on the movies’ cast, director, genre and keywords from the movies’ plots. The system also displays a timeline graph to observe trends across movie genres over time for multiple Y-Axis categories. The pairing of this layout with the timeline graph and various control options, enables our users to gain valuable insights into movie trends over the years with respect to attributes like popularity, revenue, rating and genre. Users can browse movies based on their personal preferences by applying filters. The brushing and linking in our system is essential in showing our users the full picture of the data.
